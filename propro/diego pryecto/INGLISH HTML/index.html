       <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>• Our project plans to help and satisfy young people with the planning and emergence of their professional future,</p>
        <p>acquiring various sources of information, possible links and contacts, issues of academic indecision.</p>
        <p>• This “Profession Your Life” project wants to explain the importance of choosing an appropriate profession and the impact it has on personal and professional life.</p>
        <p>How you can choose a career that is not only suitable in the present, but also offers long-term comfort and growth.</p>

        <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
        <p>• The population to whom this project is directed is so opinion-changing, that is, undecided about what 

what they want to do with their studies;</p>
        <p>They can also be people with low or moderate income, looking for help to get started professionally and this 

leads to really identifying the population's abilities,</p>
        <p>knowledge, talents and virtues taking into account the economic situation of the subject in order to find the career and 

the most favorable university.</p>
        <p>• We will look at what information from universities we can access more easily to implement them, we will make known 

our website in the different local schools through campaigns, we will go to the</p>                  
        <p>higher courses at our school, showing them how it works and we will collect information about how useful it can be 

become.</p>

        <h2>JUSTIFICATION</h2>
        <p>•We have realized that most of our classmates do not know what to study or how to get into a university, and 

those who are not sure about starting a career,</p>
        <p>and they prefer to work for the current minimum wage, without a good employment contract, in most cases this discourages them 

and they lose interest in the study by not achieving their objectives.</p>
        <p>We want to implement a quantitative methodology to be able to have different points of view.</p>
